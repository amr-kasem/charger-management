# OCPP Management System Documentation

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive **OCPP (Open Charge Point Protocol) Compliant Electric Vehicle Charge Point Operator (CPO) solution** built on AWS cloud infrastructure. The system enables scalable management of electric vehicle charging stations with full support for OCPP 1.6, 2.0, and 2.0.1 protocols.

## System Architecture

The solution implements a modern serverless Charging Station Management System (CSMS) using AWS IoT Core, Lambda functions, and containerized gateway services. It provides secure, scalable, and cost-effective management of EV charging infrastructure.
